# Web Interface

This package is responsible for the web interface of the application. It provides a web server that displays the logs of the executed scripts and the JSON metadata for each asset.

The web interface is built with [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/) and provides a modern, user-friendly experience.

## Files

- `server.go`: This file implements the web server and its routes.
- `server_test.go`: This file contains unit tests for the web server.
- `assets/patternfly.min.css`: The PatternFly CSS stylesheet.
